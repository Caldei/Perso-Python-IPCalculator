## What is IPCalculator? 
You will find several tools that will help you to address your Networks.   

These tools are:
* C2M : CIDR to Mask Convertor
* M2C : Mask to CIDR Convertor
* W2M : WildCard Mask to Mask Convertor
* RangeCalc : Network Range Calculator
* SubNetCalc : SubNets Calculator

# 
## C2M :
### Input : 
* CIDR
#### Outputs : 
* Decimal Mask
* Wildcard Mask
* Binary Mask
* Number of potential IPs with this mask
* Number of potential usable IPs with this mask
* Number of potential Subnets 

# 
## M2C :
### Input : 
* Decimal Mask
#### Outputs : 
* CIDR
* Wildcard Mask
* Binary Mask
* Number of potential IPs with this mask
* Number of potential usable IPs with this mask
* Number of potential Subnets 

# 
## W2C :
### Input : 
* Wildcard Mask
#### Outputs : 
* CIDR
* Decimal Mask
* Binary Mask
* Number of potential IPs with this mask
* Number of potential usable IPs with this mask
* Number of potential Subnets 

# 
## RangeCalc :
### Inputs : 
* IP
* Decimal Mask or CIDR
#### Outputs : 
* Network Address of the Subnet
* Broadcast Address of the Subnet
* Number of IPs in the Subnet
* Number of usable IPs in the Subnet

# 
## SubNetCalc :
* IP
* Decimal Mask or CIDR
* Number of Subnets needed
* Number of users needed per Subnet
#### Outputs : 
* Network Address (for each Subnets)
* Broadcast Address (for each Subnets)
* Mask (for each Subnets)
* CIDR (for each Subnets)
* Number of IPs (for each Subnets)
* Number of usable IPs (for each Subnets)
